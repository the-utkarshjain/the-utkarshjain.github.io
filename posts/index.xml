      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I am Utkarsh Jain, and I am going to the University of California San Diego to pursue a Master’s of Science in Computer Science degree. As a part of going to the USA, I applied for the F-1 visa, and with this blog, I aim to delineate the overall procedure of getting the student visa. So, without further ado, let’s get right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please remember to go through all the resources I have shared in this blog to get an even better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied for Master’s programs in Computer Science (fall ‘22 intake) to USA-based universities. Speaking from personal experience, I know that applying to universities abroad can be confusing and tiresome. That is precisely why I am writing this article, in the hope of unentangling this long and convoluted process for you. I will begin by briefly introducing myself, and then immediately get into the application procedure. Make sure you go through all the resources I have shared in this article to get an even better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
