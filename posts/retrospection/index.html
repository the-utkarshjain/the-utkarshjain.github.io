  "articleBody": "It has been almost two years since I wrote my last blog, and a lot has changed in my life since then. I wrote my last blog before joining the University of California, San Diego for my graduate degree, and as of today, it has been almost two months since I finished my studies and graduated. This blog serves as a closure for that journey, and I am writing this to note down a few key details that people often miss.\nBefore I started my master’s program at UC San Diego, I had no idea how to get internships or jobs, or how to fund my education through Teaching Assistantships (TA-ships) and research positions. A few highly proactive students (proactive, not necessarily smart) among us, who had the right guidance, secured internships with FAANG companies even before the program started and obtained funding opportunities to pay for their education. Unfortunately, I wasn’t one of them, and as a result, I ended up putting a strain on my parents’ finances. However, this experience was valuable for me as it taught me the importance of being proactive and developing people skills.\nBeing Proactive is More Rewarding than Being Smart Don’t get me wrong—being smart is very important. Being good at what you do will take you a long way in life. But just being smart alone will not necessarily bring you good opportunities. You have to be proactive as well.\nFor example, I initially thought that simply filling out the online TA application form would be sufficient to secure a TA position at the university. I assumed that my intelligence alone would shine through and that the university would recognize this from my application. WRONG. By the second quarter of my master’s program, I realized that merely submitting the application wasn’t enough. What really makes a difference is reaching out to professors to express your interest in TA-ing for their course. Those of us who knew this secret managed to secure TA-ships much earlier and were pleased to have half of their tuition waived.\nI adopted the same approach and reached out to professors aggressively. Fortunately, I landed a TA-ship in the third quarter of my master’s program. The university then waived half of my tuition, covered my insurance, and provided a monthly stipend. I was thrilled.\nLesson learned: No matter how smart you are, you need to make yourself visible for someone to notice you.\nBeing Proactive is Important, but Luck Plays a Very Big Role Too There are two main ways to fund your education: through Teaching Assistantships (TAships) or Research Assistantships (RAships). Both typically provide a monthly stipend at most universities, and in some well-known institutions, they also help waive a portion of your tuition. For example, at UC San Diego, TAships waive half of the tuition, while RAships cover it entirely. However, RAships are significantly harder to secure.\nWhen I joined UC San Diego, I never imagined securing an RAship because it seemed a bit out of my league. Interestingly, I placed third in a course during the second quarter, and the professor invited me to join his lab the following quarter. I didn’t expect him to fund my education, but he was impressed with my performance and decided to cover the rest of my tuition. Typically, students carefully approach professors to secure funded positions in their labs. In my case, I didn’t reach out to any professors, yet this incredible opportunity fell into my lap. As a result, I didn’t pay a single penny for the remainder of my master’s program. In fact, I saved enough to break even on the expenses from the first two quarters—effectively making my education completely free!\nLesson learned: While being proactive and putting yourself out there is important, luck plays a significant role. Unfortunately, luck is something you can’t control. It may sometimes work in your favor, but often it does not. DO NOT RELY ON IT.\nGood Things Take Time - Be Patient. During the first two quarters of my master’s, when I had no funding or internships, I spent a lot of time questioning what I was doing wrong. Was I not smart enough? Was I not reaching out to enough people? Why was I struggling so much? These are natural questions, and self-doubt can creep in when you aren’t “achieving” anything. However, over the last two years, I’ve come to realize that good things take time, and manifestation is real.\nFor example, when I joined UC San Diego, I never imagined working with my thesis advisor. But when the opportunity arose, I seized it, and it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my master’s program. It took time—about 6-7 months—for this opportunity to present itself.\nAs for manifestation, here’s an example: During the final months of my master’s, I was searching for jobs, primarily in the field of LLMs and RAGs. I had the chance to interview with a start-up working exactly in that area. All my interviews went well, and I was confident they would hire me. I really wanted to join that company. However, they ultimately decided to move forward with a more experienced candidate. Surprisingly, just two days after the rejection, the CTO of the company called me and offered an internship position. Although it wasn’t what I had initially envisioned, I eagerly accepted and joined their fantastic team. Manifestation is real.\nSkills Matter Being proactive, manifesting, and luck play significant roles in securing the opportunities you’re seeking. However, once you have that opportunity, your skills—both technical and interpersonal—will define your place in the organization. Being good at your job and being a good colleague will help you build lasting relationships.\nBeing good at your job does not mean you need to know absolutely everything, but it does require a strong foundation and a willingness to put in extra effort to learn new concepts quickly. Similarly, being a good colleague does not mean ingratiating yourself with your seniors, but it does involve supporting your team with your skills and maintaining a friendly demeanor.\nDuring my time at UC San Diego, I worked in 4-5 different labs and made many friends. Although I no longer work with them, I still keep in touch and stay connected. Many of my friends are older than I am, some are full professors, and their advice and guidance continue to help me make better decisions in my life.\nConclusion What did I learn from my two years at UC San Diego? I learned that life is often random, but that doesn’t mean you should stop putting in effort. Instead, it means you should shift your focus away from the destination (easier said than done) and pay more attention to the journey, concentrating on doing things that matter to you.\n",
